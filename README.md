# Godot_Zebra
 Zebra Puzzles in Godot

 This is a test of using Python code in Godot.

 The Python code came from https://github.com/tuchandra/zebra/tree/main (MIT licence) and, as stated by the author, it's really an 'unmaintained playground'. However, it does seem to generate reasonable 4x4 & 5x5 grids :)

 The version of Godot used is 3.4.5 (since this was the version I had installed for another test project that required speech and the speech addon only worked up to 3.4.5 :()

 Hope someone finds it useful.

 PS: The way I handle the 100% external Python code is by calling Python.exe as follows:

  OS.execute(path, args, true, stdout)

 Where 'path' is the path to the Python.exe in the Godot project, 'args' is the size of the grid (either 4 or 5) and 'stdout' is the text generated by the Python code.
 I then read the text file and parse it within Godot.
